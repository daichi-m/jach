# JaCh

JaCh (shorthand for Java Channels) is a library that brings the power of Golang's channels into
Java. The channel abstraction of Golang is an adaptation of the Communicating Sequential Processes
(CSP) concept. JaCh aims to provide classes and methods that mimic go's syntax as far as possible 
to do it without violating Java's syntax.
